# Eat and Split Project

This application, **Eat and Split**, is designed for splitting bills among friends after dining out together. It allows users to:

## Features

- **Manage a list of friends**: Add and display friends with randomly generated images.
- **Split bills**: Select a friend and input the total bill amount along with each person's share. The app calculates who owes whom.
- **Track payments**: Indicate who paid the bill and automatically calculate the owed amounts.

## UI Components

- **Add Friend Form**: Add new friends to the list.
